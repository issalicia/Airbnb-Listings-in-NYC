# Airbnb-Listings-in-NYC
For this project, I utilized a comprehensive toolkit that included Excel, Tableau, and PowerPoint to meticulously analyze Airbnb listings in New York City. The primary goal was to determine whether there is a significant correlation between the geographic location of these listings and their likelihood of being booked.

Working alongside my partner, we performed critical data preparation and formatting to ensure the dataset's integrity and quality. We then leveraged Tableau's powerful visualization capabilities to gain valuable insights into the relationship between location and booking rates. These insights were distilled into a compelling PowerPoint presentation, making the findings accessible and informative for stakeholders.

This project showcases our expertise in data analysis and visualization, as well as our ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets to support strategic decision-making.
